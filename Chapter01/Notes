Addition:
    I. On linux use the following commands to install the lint tools:
        sudo apt install splint      # Install Splint
        sudo apt install cppcheck    # Install cppcheck
        sudo apt install clang-Tidy  # Install Clang-tidy
    II. Use the following to run the tools for a program named "myprogram.c":
        splint myprogram.c
        cppcheck --enable=all myprogram.c
        clang-tidy myprogram.c -- -std=c99
